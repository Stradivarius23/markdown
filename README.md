  note right of BC
     We always keep up to date only the master branch, 
     we need to make all necessary changes 
     on CI before starting the release
  end note

  note right of REJ
     These jobs are essential before starting the release 
     and show us that the pipeline is working as expected
  end note
  
  note right of Blocker
      We can't fix issues related to Gerrit, Jenkins, Gitlab, BitBar, Artifactory
  end note
